# Citizen-Operated Low-Cost Sensors for Estimating Outdoor Particulate Matter Infiltration

This repository includes scripts developed for the analysis conducted in the "Citizen-Operated Low-Cost Sensors for Estimating Outdoor Particulate Matter Infiltration" paper submitted to npj | Climate and Atmospheric Science. 
The manuscript is focused on investigating the between indoor and outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> data gathered using low-cost sensor technologies.
